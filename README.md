Sample-Advanced-Using-IntroJS
=============================

A little page with somes samples for use IntroJS like a boss ;)

I use IntroJS for a Website and I really like this Lib, I used it for a complex dynamic page 
and I needed to use some little functions to get really cool result.

It's a sample of that you can do with this Lib, and for my sample I use jQuery, but Intro JS don't
used jQuery and I expect to work on a new version without it.
